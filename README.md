Hello, welcome to TO-DO!

TO-DO is an intuitive Google Chrome extension that will greet you and save your to-do list.

Once you install the extension and open a tab on Google Chrome, you will see a tiny smiley face icon.
Clicking on the extension icon, a side panel will open in your tab.
The setting button will allow you to enter your name, so that the extension can greet you next time you open it.

Underneath the greeting message, there is an input bar and an "add" button.

In the input bar you can write a task for the day, and add it to your list by clicking the "add" button.

Added tasks can be crossed out and eliminated as well.
To hide the side bar, just click again on the extension icon in your tab.
The extension makes use of local storage to save your username and tasks for future reference.
